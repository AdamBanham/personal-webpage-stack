# Adding new Articles

Frist a card needs to be generated in ./content/... and ensure that 
./content/allcontent.js is updated. A card is generated by creating a new
instance of BlogInfo (implemented in blogElements.js).

Then in ./article/content/... generate a new article structure and ensure
that the article is added to allContent.

The ArticleStructure object is used to generate sections in the expanded 
page if the card is clicked.

## Adding tags to Article cards 

To add a new tag, use the dictionary in tagList.js
