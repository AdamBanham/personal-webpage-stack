        `Process mining facilitates analysis of business processes using event 
        logs derived from historical records of process executions stored in 
        organisations' information systems. Most existing process mining 
        techniques only consider data  directly related to process execution 
        (endogenous data). Data not directly representable as attributes of 
        either events or traces (which includes exogenous data), are generally
         not considered. Exogenous data may be used by process participants 
         in making decisions about execution paths. However, as exogenous data
         is not represented in event logs, its impact on such decision making is
         opaque and cannot currently be assessed by existing process mining 
        techniques. This paper shows how exogenous data can be used in process 
        mining, in particular discovery and enhancement techniques, to understand
         its influence on process decisions. In particular, we focus on time series
         which represent periodic observations of e.g. weather measurements, city 
        health alerts or patient vital signs. We show that exogenous time series can
         be aligned and transformed into new attributes to annotate events in an 
        event log. Then, we use these attributes to discover preconditions in a 
        Petri net with exogenous data (xDPN), thus revealing the exogenous data's 
        influence on the process.`,

        `Process mining is a well-established discipline with applications in 
        many industry sectors, including healthcare.
        To date, few publications have considered the context in which 
        processes execute. 
        Little consideration has been given as to how contextual data 
        (exogenous data) can be practically included for process mining 
        analysis, beyond including case or event attributes in a typical 
        event log.
        We show that the combination of process data (endogenous) and 
        exogenous data can generate insights not possible with standard 
        process mining techniques.
        Our contributions are a framework for process mining with 
        exogenous data and new analyses, where exogenous data and process 
        behaviour are linked to process outcomes.
        Our new analyses visualise exogenous data, highlighting the trends 
        and variations, to show where overlaps or distinctions exist between 
        outcomes.
        We applied our analyses in a healthcare setting and show that clinicians
         could extract insights about differences in patientsâ€™ vital signs 
         (exogenous data) relevant to clinical outcomes.
        We present two evaluations, using a publicly available data set, 
        MIMIC--III, to demonstrate the applicability of our analysis. 
        These evaluations show that process mining can integrate large 
        amounts of physiologic data and interventions, with resulting 
        discrimination and conversion to clinically interpretable information.`,

        Process mining uses historical executions of business processes 
        (as recorded in an event log) to uncover and describe the processâ€™ 
        behaviour as a process model. The goal of conformance checking is to
        ensure that the model is of high quality and is a good representation 
        of the event log, thus assuring the model is a solid foundation for 
        subsequent analysis of the process. To date, few conformance checking 
        approaches have considered model quality beyond what is determined by 
        the execution order of process activities. In data-aware process models, 
        which are generated by decision mining techniques, process activities are
        annotated with conditions to represent the decision-making of a process.
         Such models are more expressive than those that represent only process 
         activities. With the current notions of conformance checking, it is
        unclear what properties determine the quality of these data-aware 
        process models. To address this gap, we introduce desirable properties, 
        as axioms, for conformance checking of data-aware models. Our contribution
        is threefold: i) we present a generalisation that abstracts from the 
        representation of data-aware models, ii) we present nine axioms of 
        desirable properties for data-aware conformance checking, and iii) we 
        define two measures for model recall and precision. Using our axioms as 
        a yardstick, we compare our proposed recall and precision measures with 
        existing measures. Our experimental results show that existing measures
        exhibit limited adherence to our axioms; while, our two proposed 
        measures exhibit high adherence to our axioms.

         `Process mining, when applied to data stored in the information systems of businesses, provides insights into the internal performance of their processes.
        These insights reveal how the behaviour of processes impacts businesses, and can inform planning for various future scenarios by anticipating how processes will perform in these scenarios.
        However, these scenarios may be influenced by the context of the process, i.e., external data streams (exogenous data) to the process.
        In these cases, typical process discovery techniques can produce process models that describe what activities could occur next in a given state, but cannot express the effect of external influences on how likely these are to occur.
        Our contribution presents an extension of stochastic labelled Petri nets and a discovery technique for our new modelling formalism.
        The proposed formalism can be used to quantify whether the firing likelihood of a transition is influenced by exogenous data when replaying historical process executions over the net.
        We compare our approach against existing stochastic techniques over several publicly available event logs.
        Our results show that our approach can outperform existing data-aware techniques in unstructured processes.
